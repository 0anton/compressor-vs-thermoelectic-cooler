# 2. Measurement system

## Temperature measurement

For temperature measurement I've took [Aqara temperature sensor](https://www.aqara.com/us/temperature_humidity_sensor.html) for its preciseness (0.3°C according to manufacturer) and low inertion. Sensor polls data frequently (at least every 10 seconds) and sends the update if the value has changed above the threashold.

## Power measurement

For power measurement I've took [Aqara Smart Plug](https://www.aqara.com/eu/smart_outlet.html). It has accumulating, increasing counter for energy use and momentary power consumption sensort. Poll times upto 1s (1HZ) if the measured value change comes other the threashold.

## Noise level measurement

I took app DecibelX v.9.5.0 running on my iPhone 11 Pro Max iOS 15.6.
